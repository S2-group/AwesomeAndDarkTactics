t-description: "Right sizing is the process of matching instance types and sizes to your workload performance and capacity requirements at the lowest possible cost. More-over, it involves the identification of opportunities to downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements. From an energy perspective, it can be assessed which resources are most suitable to optimize for energy efficiency. For example, data can be stored using several different services (e.g., S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage, Glacier, Tape). Where the data is stored, impacts the energy consumption."
