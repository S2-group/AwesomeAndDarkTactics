t-description: " Edge computing infrastructures are distributed across multiple actors and include a variety of devices. Moreover, the edge applications are also very diverse and do not require the same type of service from the edge provider. This creates fragmentation and silo thinking of different natures. Four types of such silos have been identified: application-specific, software-stack-specific, data source-specific, and provider-specific."

t-context: "Normal operation"
t-feature: "Ownership is split among many actors"
t-intent: "Making it hard to optimize and share resources, hindering communication outside of your edge (silo thinking)"
t-intentmeasure: "Level of fragmentation (how many actors in a given area)"
t-countermeasure: "The concept of Edge Exchange can be introduced as a way to enable cross-actor cooperation and resource sharing, while still providing control and accountability."
