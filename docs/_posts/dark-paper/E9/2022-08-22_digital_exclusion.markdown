t-description: "Digital exclusion happens when new technology that requires advanced or new infrastructure or devices is not going to be available for all, thus preventing a part of the target end users (either in different countries or inside the same country) to get access to services. The complexity of computing at the edge makes it increasingly difficult for edge providers to plan for and provision resources to meet the ongoing dramatic growth in demand. A strategy often adopted by edge providers is to focus only on a part of the potential users, typically those bringing highest revenues, hence widening the digital divide and contributing to a society that is socially unsustainable."
t-participant: "edge-provider, government"
t-artifact: "Technology or specific services requiring specific HW/SW - depending on the type of exclusion"
t-context: "Deployment and normal operation"
t-feature: "Service users are excluded from"
t-intent: "Excluding part of end users because of difficulties to access/use services"
t-intentmeasure: "Number of people excluded from services (different metrics depending on category)"
t-countermeasure: "Make trade-offs between the benefits of edge computing like reducing latency and energy consumption, and the investments needed to avoid digital exclusion. For example, in healthcare personalized home-care (hence at the edge) is meant to learn the profile of the patient and adapt for usability."
