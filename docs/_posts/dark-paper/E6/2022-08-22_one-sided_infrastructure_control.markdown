categories: edge-computing
t-description: "If the owner of the edge infrastructure has malicious intentions, it is easy for him to cut access to the technology or control the people using it (e.g., in a dictatorship). This represents a social sustainability threat to anyone using the technology while not in full control of the equipment and applications in the infrastructure. In fact, security and privacy issues are mentioned as more prominent in edge than in cloud."

t-feature: "Infrastructure owner privileges"
t-intent: "Giving great privileges to whoever owns the infrastructure"
t-intentmeasure: "Extent of (un)lawful interception"
t-countermeasure: "It is necessary to establish trust between the devices, for which there exist an important body of work (see the paper for references). Of course these trust evaluation mechanisms come with an overhead, as discussed in tactic 'trust overhead'."
