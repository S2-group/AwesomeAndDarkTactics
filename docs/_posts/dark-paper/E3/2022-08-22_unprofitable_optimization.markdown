t-description: "Since the energy consumption of an edge computing centre is usually not very high (because of its small size and the type of devices used), there is currently no incentive for the provider to optimize resource utilization in order to save energy."
t-participant: "edge-provider, edge-user"
t-artifact: "Infrastructure"
t-context: "Normal operation"
t-feature: "Cost or business model, switching on/off techniques"
t-intent: "Making it not profitable to perform resource consumption optimization on the provider side"
t-intentmeasure: "Level of incentives"
t-countermeasure: "Shifting to another business model where the users are charged only for the actual time they use resources and not, as before, for reserving resources even if they are not using it. This is called serverless computing and it pushes the incentive on the provider to optimize so that they decrease the amount of idle resources, for which they will not get paid anymore."
