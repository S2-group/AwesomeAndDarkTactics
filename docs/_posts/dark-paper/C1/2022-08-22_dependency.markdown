t-description: "In some situations, the cloud user may become dependent on the cloud provider, and he risks being compromised would the cloud provider not provide services with high enough quality. For example, if the customer support does not handle issues in a good way (e.g., by taking a long time to solve issues) and the cloud user is completely dependent on the customer support to solve any problem, then this creates unsustainability. Relying heavily on cloud providers and therefore lacking planning and preparation to deal with unexpected issues with the cloud service has been identified as one of the major risks when adopting cloud computing."
