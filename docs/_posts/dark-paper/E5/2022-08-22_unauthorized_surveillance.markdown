t-description: "Because the edge is closer to the edge users and end users, access to applications running at the edge generate more and richer metadata, like the user geolocation (and movements) by monitoring the location of the edge device, or the presence and use of collocated applications e.g., for smart-home or IoT appliances. This enables exploiting metadata against privacy, sometimes authorized (e.g., in smart surveillance for safety reasons), but often unauthorized with malicious intents (e.g., facial spoofing, people tracking) or for commercial reasons (e.g., monitoring of customers behavior)."
