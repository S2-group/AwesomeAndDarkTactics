t-description: "Energy-aware scheduling refers to a strategy that optimizes the scheduling of machine learning tasks. It dynamically schedules tasks or processes based on the current energy requirements and system conditions. The objective of an energy-aware dynamic scheduling policy is to make efficient use of available computational resources."
