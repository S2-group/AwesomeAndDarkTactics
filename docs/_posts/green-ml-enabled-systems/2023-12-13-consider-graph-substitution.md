t-description: "In the context of deep neural networks (DNN), graph substitution refers to replacing a large model with a smaller one that performs a similar task.  Energy-aware graph substitution, however, means replacing energy-intensive nodes of deep neural networks with less energy-consuming nodes (Wang et al 2020)."
