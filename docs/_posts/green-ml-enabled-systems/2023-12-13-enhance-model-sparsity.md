t-description: "Enhancing sparsity of a machine learning model means reducing the number of model parameters or setting their values to zero. For example, weight sparsification involves identifying and removing unnecessary or less important weights in a neural network. Enhancing model sparsity decreases the complexity of the model and consequently reduces requirements for storage and memory. Therefore, it also results in lower power consumption."
