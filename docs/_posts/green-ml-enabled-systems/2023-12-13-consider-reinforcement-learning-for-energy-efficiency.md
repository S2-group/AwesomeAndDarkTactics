t-description: "Algorithms can be designed to optimize energy efficiency through reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning receives feedback on its actions and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Reinforcement learning models can be used to identify the most energy-efficient options in real-time and make informed decisions based on this information. Additionally, other quality attributes can also be targeted for optimization."
