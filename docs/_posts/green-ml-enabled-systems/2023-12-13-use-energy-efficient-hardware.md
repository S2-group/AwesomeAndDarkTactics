t-description: "The emissions of machine learning are related to used hardware. This is why using energy-efficient hardware to run machine models can reduce the power consumption of models. Energy-efficient hardware can include low-energy components. For example, the Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) developed by Google are seen as an energy-efficient alternative to CPUs and GPUs."
