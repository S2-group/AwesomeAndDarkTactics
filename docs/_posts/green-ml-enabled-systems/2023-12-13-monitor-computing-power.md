t-description: "Estimating and calculating the energy footprint of a machine learning model can help to reduce the computational power of ML models. Monitoring the energy consumption of a ML model in the long term helps to identify those components where energy is being inefficiently utilized. This can serve as a starting point for making improvements to reduce energy consumption. There has been a lack of easy-to-use tools to do that, but recently  researchers have provided frameworks for how to estimate or calculate the energy footprint of machine learning."
