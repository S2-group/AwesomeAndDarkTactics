t-description: "The distributed nature of edge computing leads to a lot of hardware being produced. This has an impact on resource utilization that has to be investigated both for producing them but also for running them, i.e. to perform lifecycle assessments. As part of this effort, Pirson & Bol provide a carbon footprint assessment of IoT edge devices (focusing on the production and transport phases) that shows the consequent impact these devices have."

t-intent: "Spreading hardware devices that need to be produced"
t-intentmeasure: "Amount of hardware needed, Life cycle assessment of the hardware considered"
t-countermeasure: "Use already existing devices as edge devices (for example embedded systems) instead of building dedicated edge devices."
