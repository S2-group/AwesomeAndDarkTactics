t-description: "Edge devices are by default considered as being always on even when they do nothing. This causes energy waste, but enables real-time services (like in-hospital patient monitoring or cloud gaming) anytime, or at least when needed."

t-artifact: "Infrastructure "
t-context: "Normal operation"
t-feature: "Switching off devices"
t-intent: "Consuming energy to enable real-time services all the time"
t-intentmeasure: "Uptime of a service (availability) and energy use"
t-countermeasure: "Cloud computing faced a similar problem in the past; countermeasures for the edge may build upon those created for the cloud."
