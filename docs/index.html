        The Archive of Awesome and Dark Tactics is a knowledge base of tactics extracted from research and industry practice, that have either a positive or negative effect on a target level of quality. While some tactics can be applied to a specific software artifact, there exist tactics that are focused on other aspects of engineering, such as related hardware components or managerial decisions.

    <p>
        <strong>Awesome Tactics</strong> are tactics that help achieve a positive effect. Awesome Tactics are a collection of <em>Architectural Tactics</em> (ATs) and <em>Software Practices</em> (SPs). <em>Architectural Tactics</em> are design decisions that influence the achievement of a specific quality attribute response, therefore, they only have one quality attribute as a target. On the other hand, <em>Software Practices</em> can target multiple quality attributes, and can be seen as "best practices" for software developers that can be applied anywhere in the software development process.

    <p>
        <strong>Dark Tactics</strong> are tactics that when applied, possibly unknowingly, achieve some negative effect. Dark Tactics represent <em>Unsustainable Patterns</em> (UPs); these are patterns that are unsustainable in their nature in a broad sense, in which we include economical, environmental and social concerns. We complement Dark Tactics with a countermeasure, aiming to be a solution for the unsustainable pattern that is presented.
